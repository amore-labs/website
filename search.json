    "title": "The AutoML Benchmark",
    "section": "Why do we need a standardized benchmark?",
    "text": "Why do we need a standardized benchmark?\nWe started the project back in 2018. Over the summer, I (Pieter Gijsbers) got together with Erin LeDell and Janek Thomas to work on three problems we had identified:\n\nin the field of automated machine learning (in 2018), different papers would rarely evaluate their methods on the same data, and\nresearchers would often make simple “user errors” when evaluating methods proposed by others, and\nthe analyses were almost exclusively focused on predictive performance.\n\nWe decided to address these problems by introducing a benchmark suite, benchmark software, and a multi-dimensional analysis. That initially culminated into an introductory paper at the AutoML Workshop at ICML 2019, and ultimately in our publication at the Journal of Machine Learning Research. Let’s have a closer look at why these problems needed solving and our resulting contributions.\n\nThe Benchmark Suite\nResearch papers evaluating their methods using different sets of data inadvertently means that results are not comparable across different papers. This makes it impossible to determine state-of-the-art or to track progress in the field overtime. It may also lead to accidentally reporting optimistic results. For example, when researchers use a dataset both during development and evaluation, design decisions are made during development which improve performance for that dataset, but it is unlikely that it improves performance for unseen datasets equally. Thus, performance on that dataset is likely optimistic (i.e., better) compared to what you would expect on unseen datasets.\nEven if datasets used in evaluation are not used during development, the researchers’ bias on which type of data they find important, such as biomedical data or big data, may lead to a similar “accidental cherry picking”. That type of data is reasonably assumed to be present during both development and evaluation, and other types of data for which the methods were not developed may be absent also in evaluation. This means that areas where methods may have blind spots are not evaluated and not reported on, giving an incomplete picture of the method’s strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\n\nHaving a curated set of datasets for evaluation managed by the community and carefully chosen to represent various data domains and characteristics should alleviate these problems. That is why we propose the initial version of such a standardized benchmark suite. The benchmarking suite contains 71 classification and 33 regression datasets that come from many different domains and exhibit many different dataset characteristics. We hope that with a benchmarking suite of this size and variety, we can trust in the generalizability of the results obtained.\n\n\nThe Benchmark Software\nAnother consequence of using a different set of data for each paper is that researchers need to evaluate the methods of others on their data. There are multiple examples where a method’s performance reported in papers are, for lack of a better word, the result of misunderstandings (or “user errors”). For example, a paper introducing method \\(X\\) and comparing it against state-of-the-art framework \\(Y\\) would report a failure of framework \\(Y\\) on dataset \\(D\\). In several cases we could diagnose the problem that caused the failure of framework \\(Y\\) on dataset \\(D\\) directly from the paper or a few minutes of inspecting the code. Examples would include using an out-of-date release or a wrong configuration of framework \\(Y\\).\n\n\n\nLuckily, as computer scientists, we have a wonderful tool in our belt to reduce human error: automation. That’s why we built standardized benchmarking software complete with developer-friendly AutoML framework integrations.\nWith the paper we released our open source benchmarking software. It allows you to run an AutoML evaluation with a single command. A simple python runbenchmark.py autosklearn openml/s/271 1h8c is all you need to evaluate autosklearn on our entire classification benchmark (OpenML suite 271). The software takes care of installing autosklearn, (down)loading the data and providing it to autosklearn, configuring autosklearn with a 1 hour time constraints with a limit of 8 CPU cores (hence 1h8c), monitoring its progress, and processing the predictions of the final model.\nThis level of automation means that no one is accidentally training on a test set. No one accidentally uses different parallelization for different AutoML frameworks, and no one accidentally optimizes for the wrong metrics. It’s a great step forward for fair comparisons. At least, that’s the idea. In many cases we make good on the promise, but we are working with a moving target (new framework releases) and bugs happen (see “The Future” below).\nThe way we achieve this is by collaborating with AutoML framework developers. We built a strong shared framework that takes care of bootstrapping the experimental setup. It has generic functionalities for (down)loading data, installing dependencies, keeping track of experiments, processing results, and so on. Then, for each framework we have a minimal integration module which requires an installation script and a Python script which takes as input the data and task description and is expected to produce predictions as output. These integration scripts are often developed by, or in collaboration with, the authors of the AutoML frameworks which significantly reduces the chance that frameworks are used or configured incorrectly.\n\n\nA Multi-Dimensional Analysis\nThe last problem we identified was a single-minded analysis of the results. AutoML frameworks were compared (almost) exclusively on predictive performance. While this is a very important aspect of the final model, it provides an incomplete picture. Depending on the application that the model is trained for, other aspects like fast inference time or interpretability may be important or even required. In those cases, being able to assess the trade-off between predictive performance and other model dimensions is crucial. The characteristics of the AutoML framework itself may also be important: is it robust? is it configurable? does it adhere to resource constraints? That’s why we advocate for a multi-dimensional analysis of the results.\n\n\n\nIn our paper we evaluate 9 AutoML frameworks on our benchmarking suite and analyze the results. When analyzing predictive performance, we answer questions like: Which framework ranks best? Is it significant? How does that translate to absolute and relative differences? Do results hold across all data characteristics, or do we see some AutoML frameworks which work particularly well on datasets with certain characteristics?\nBut we also look beyond predictive accuracy. We inspect the learned models’ inference time, and discuss its trade-off with predictive performance. We also investigate when AutoML frameworks fail and why: Is it triggered by the data? Is it misuse of resources? Do they adhere to the given time constraints?\nThe experiments in the paper are from 2023, so results would indubitably be different for frameworks today. Bugs are fixed, better methods for building better models are developed. However, we hope the paper serves as an inspiration and example for providing a more thorough multi-dimensional analysis.\n\n\nChallenges and Limitations\nFor more background, examples, challenges, and references you will want to have a look at the paper. It presents ideas presented here in more depth but also includes additional information on e.g., limitations of the benchmark, and it also contains the results and analysis of 9 frameworks on 104 datasets!"

    "section": "The Future",
    "text": "The Future\nOvertime the landscape of data problems changes, as do the capabilities of AutoML frameworks, and the benchmarking suite should be updated to reflect that. One glaring ommission in the benchmark (in my personal opinion) is the lack of text data. In the original benchmarking suite presented in the paper, all datasets have strictly numerical or categorical data. This is for historical reasons, as a significant number of the AutoML frameworks in 2018 did not handle text data natively. But text data is ubiquitous, modern AutoML frameworks are well-equipped to deal with it, so it’s time we reflect that in the benchmark.\nMoreover, there is nothing uniquely “AutoML” about the AutoML benchmark. It benchmarks anything for which you write an integration script that takes as input a task and constraint description, and provides predictions as output. Sure, many algorithms may not deal with various dataset characteristics out-of-the-box (e.g., text data may need to be encoded) and the method may not adhere to time constraints, but that doesn’t mean the software can provide much of the same benefits of automation to evaluating “regular” ML algorithms (in fact, TabRepo used AMLB). We hope to explore this further and potentially position AMLB for more general tabular ML benchmarking.\nAnd last but not least, though perhaps not as sexy, is the brunt of software engineering work. As time goes on, AutoML frameworks have new releases, people use different hardware, and AutoML is used for new problems, which means we are always working with a moving target. The benchmarking software needs to be maintained to work with modern stacks, extended to allow evaluation of different problem types, and incidental bugs need to be squashed. On top of that, we are continuously exploring ways to make the software easier to use for both developers and researchers.\nThe benchmark isn’t perfect, or even finished. It’s a start. And we invite you to collaborate with us.\nThere are many ways to contribute. The easiest way is to help is to leave a ⭐️ on our GitHub project, talk about the AutoML benchmark, and use it in your work. There are also a number of no-code contributions that help us out greatly:\n\n🤝 Help people on our GitHub issue tracker\n📚 Improve our documentation\n🤓 Identify interesting new datasets\n\nAnd finally, we very much welcome code contributions. 🧑‍💻\n\nThis post was written by Pieter Gijsbers and need not reflect the view of co-authors."

    "section": "Community Engagement and Onboarding Contributors",
    "text": "Community Engagement and Onboarding Contributors\nThe focus of this discussion was around community engagement and emphasized the importance of effectively attracting, onboarding, and retaining contributors, especially newcomers.\nOver the past few years, both in OpenML and scikit-learn, we have been noticing that a majority of contributors are only active for short durations and do not stick around for too long. The ones that do are distributed between a smaller number of more experienced senior developers and a much larger pool of junior developers. This then leads to many PR’s being of lower quality and thus requiring a lot more verification and correction.\nThe question at hand then, is not only how we can attract new contributors to our projects but also how we can make it easier for them and our developers to maintain these projects. Some of the ideas that came up have been tried and tested by communities our colleagues have founded or been part of across the globe.\nTakeaways:\n\nEmotional connection : All of the participants agreed that the most important part of any community is its people. Contributors only stick around if they have an emotional connection to either the project, or the people contributing to the project. In this vein, it would be nice if the maintainers of the project could also be present at events. It also helps if the contributors use the projects themselves.\nFocus on beginners : Since we see that most of our contributors are beginners, it serves to organize sprints that are inclusive of them with a focus on beginner-friendly issues, especially documentation tasks. Having these would not only help them understand the project and contribute better, but also let them form a connection with the project.\nCurated issues : Most of our external contributors have enough on their plate already. Having a curated list of issues before sprints would ensure that no time is wasted and let our contributors focus on the tasks suitable for them.\nDifferent tiers of events : To ensure that everyone is given tasks they can handle, it would be nice to have separate events for contributors with varying levels of expertise. This would also have the added benefit of retaining beginner-friendly issues for sprints to prevent more experienced contributors from claiming them early.\nMentoring : Incorporating one-to-one mentoring to help new contributors set up their development environments would help them feel more connected to the project. It is understandable that this is time consuming, so perhaps some way of deciding who gets mentored can be set up in time.\nContributors guide : Simplifying the contributor’s guide and adding video tutorials would make it a lot more beginner-friendly, especially to those who have never filed a pull request (PR) before.\nSemi regular events : Some of our colleagues found that they tended to care about a project more if there were semi regular events they could set time aside for. Having these helped them slowly build a sense of community as well.\nIncentives : A common question that many developers have is why they should even bother contributing. Helping them understand how contributing to open source projects can aid their careers, bring them closer to the community and also help them get internships would be a good start."

    "text": "Governance, Funding, and Sponsorship\nThis focus of this discussion was the governance structures of open-source projects, sustainable funding models, and the role of sponsorships in supporting project activities.\nTakeaways:\n\nEvolving Governance : Since governance is not static, we can treat it as a living document that evolves with the needs of the community.\nCommunication: It is good practise to maintain open communication channels, such as mailing lists and monthly meetings. This keeps all interested contributors in the loop.\nPull Requests: When a project becomes popular on GitHub, it often receives a large number of pull requests from the broader community, many of which may lack quality and become a time sink for senior developers. Finding a balance between approving and rejecting these contributions, without making the community feel unheard, remains an ongoing challenge.\nSponsorship: It would be beneficial to explore sponsorship models similar to the INRIA Foundation (website is in French), where sponsors have a voice in company policy during bi-annual meetings. Such a policy could also provide an added incentive for companies to sponsor, especially if they frequently use the products of their beneficiaries.\nCorporate partnerships: To keep investors interested, it would also be interesting to look into corporate partnerships (similar to those used by the Linux Foundation) that are of mutual benefit."

    "text": "Development Tooling and Workflows\nSetting up and maintaining CI/CD pipelines across multiple repositories and programming languages puts a huge burden on the maintainers of the repositories.\nHaving to keep up with the trends and learn new technology very frequently also makes developers more reluctant to change the stack, even if doing so would be beneficial.\nThis discussion looked at how to tackle these challenges and make it easier for developers to handle such complex workloads.\nTakeaways:\n\nAutomation: Automating as much of the CI/CD pipeline as possible by using bots for linting and code coverage checks makes PR quality control easier.\nBetter workflows: Migrating to Github Actions and Azure workflows for testing and deployment also seems to help significantly.\nOpen source tools: There are many open source platforms/tools that offer comparable convenience to tools that are currently used. Some examples of these are CodeBerg and Forgejo as an alternative to GitHub and its issue trackers. Eventually migrating to using these tools might also help manage projects like scikit-learn and OpenML.\nCircleCI: Tools for rendering documentation examples directly in the browser can also be used to enhance the review process."

    "text": "Broader Ecosystem and Scope of Collaboration\nWhile both OpenML and scikit-learn focus on the open source ML community, it is sometimes hard to explain how we fit into the broader AI ecosystem.\nEspecially with the rise of LLMs and Generative AI, stakeholders are somewhat inclined to think that frameworks such as ours are just not “enough”. Of course, this is not true at all.\nTakeaways:\n\nCommunity projects: There are so many successful examples of open source projects, and a lot can be learned from their efforts. Projects like Scientific Python for example, have very well set up CI documentation and governance processes that can be quite readily applied to any open source project.\nExploring connections: A longer term focus for both our teams would be to explore connections with other open-source ML frameworks, such as PyTorch, Tensorflow as well as AutoML tools. Doing so would also help integrate and strengthen the open-source ML communities and ecosystems."

    "section": "Discussion on Croissant",
    "text": "Discussion on Croissant\nMachine Learning datasets can consist of structure, unstructured data, or both, which makes them all the more complicated to manage. This has led to the rise of multiple “dataset formats” which further make it hard to consistently load data across platforms and tools.\nCroissant is a dataset metadata format which, among other things, describes how to load and interpret the dataset, which helps load data regardless of which underlying dataset format is used. This format is now not only compatible with the most popular ML libraries/platforms (scikit-learn, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Kaggle, Hugging Face), it is also recommended by NeurIPS (one of the topmost conferences in the AI space).\nFeatures of Croissant:\n\nSchema.org: Croissant was built on top of schema.org with more metadata information specific to ML datasets. Since it does not require any changes to the underlying data structure, existing datasets can quite easily be converted to use it.\nLayers: The format has 4 layers - Dataset level metadata, resource descriptions, content structure, and ML semantics. Each of which make it possible to encode and maintain structural information about datasets regardless of platform.\nXAI and Visualization: Analysis and visualisation of the data works out of the box for all datasets and across multiple platforms. Croissant also supports the Core RAI vocabulary for explainable AI.\nSupported Platforms: Every dataset in OpenML has a Croissant representation, while a majority of data on Kaggle and Google Dataset search also support it."

    "text": "Elif Ceren Gok Yildirim, Murat Onur Yildirim, Mert Kilickaya, Joaquin Vanschoren\n\n\nIn the rapidly evolving field of machine learning, one challenge remains particularly persistent: the ability to continually learn new information without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. This forgetting problem is generally referred to in the field as “catastrophic forgetting”. Catastrophic forgetting occurs because, while models are learning new tasks, they lose the ability to recall information about previously learned tasks. This happens because the model’s parameters are updated to fit the new data, which can overwrite the representations of the old data.\n\n\n\nClass-Incremental Learning is one challenging scenario in CL which aims to update a model’s parameters and expand the classification layer to learn new categories while maintaining its accuracy on previously observed classes. Then during the test time, it assumes not to have access to task ids.\n\n\n\nThree major approaches have been explored to mitigate this issue:\n\nRegularization-based Methods: These techniques prevent abrupt shifts in the neural network weights by applying penalties that stabilize important parameters.\nReplay-based Methods: These involve storing a subset of training data and replaying it during the learning of new tasks to maintain previous knowledge.\nArchitecture-based Methods: These methods adapt the network structure, either by expanding it or isolating parts of it to retain past information.\n\n\n\n\nAll these CL methods bring additional hyperparameters to the learning process. For example: regularization strength, learning rate, memory size, etc. Current methods define these hyperparameters to a fixed value and assume that using the same hyperparameter setting will be sufficient for learning all different subsequent tasks. However, this approach does not reflect a realistic scenario. We can imagine 2 realistic scenarios:\n##High Plasticity- Low Stability: Let’s say you have learned large animal categories and now you will have to learn vehicle categories. In this case, you would go for mid-to low regularization strength to learn the new categories. In addition to that, you might want to store many exemplars from the large animal category in the memory buffer because you will probably forget that since the vehicle category will change the model’s parameters a lot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis time you have learned small vehicle categories and now you will have to learn large vehicle categories. In this case, you would think that these two subsequent tasks are intuitively similar so you don’t need to lower regularization strength because with high regularization, model weights will not change too much and current weights will probably be sufficient to learn the large vehicle category. Also, you might not want to store many exemplars from small vehicle categories because you did not change the model’s weights too much and you don’t want to use your budget unnecessarily.\n\n\n\nAdaCL (Adaptive Continual Learning) introduces a novel approach where learning rate, regularization, and memory size are treated as dynamic, tunable variables. Instead of being fixed, these parameters adapt according to the learner’s current condition and the complexity of the task.\nBut how to find optimum hyperparameter values?\nSearch Algorithm = Tree Parzen Estimators\nValidation set = some amount of data from the current task + some amount of data from previous tasks.\nTo achieve this, we use an AutoML tool which is Optuna and as a search algorithm, we apply Bayesian Optimization Tree Parzen Estimators. AdaCL searches and predicts the optimal values for these hyperparameters by evaluating the model’s performance on the validation set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur experiments utilized two well-known datasets: CIFAR100 and MiniImageNet. Each dataset contains images from 100 different categories, and we trained all models with 10 tasks, with each task containing 10 classes. Standard metrics for evaluation were used:\nAccuracy (ACC) measures the final accuracy averaged over all tasks.\nBackward Transfer (BWT) measures the average accuracy change of each task after learning new tasks.\nWe compared AdaCL with various baseline methods including EWC, LwF, iCaRL, and WA but the GOOD NEWS is: it is a plugged-in approach that means you can actually combine it with other methods that require better hyperparameter setting in CL.\n\n\n\nKey Findings:\n\nAdaCL boosts the performance of regularization-based methods.\nAdaCL yields better resource usage by leading to less memory size with the same performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdaCL treats crucial hyperparameters as adaptable, addressing the challenges of CIL more effectively than traditional fixed-parameter approaches. We aim to underscore the importance of flexible, dynamic adaptation in the CL scenario. For those interested in further details, the full paper provides an in-depth analysis of the methods, experimental setup, and results.

    "text": "Elif Ceren Gok Yildirim, Murat Onur Yildirim, Mert Kilickaya, Joaquin Vanschoren\n\n\nIn the rapidly evolving field of machine learning, one challenge remains particularly persistent: the ability to continually learn new information without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. This forgetting problem is generally referred to in the field as “catastrophic forgetting”. Catastrophic forgetting occurs because, while models are learning new tasks, they lose the ability to recall information about previously learned tasks. This happens because the model’s parameters are updated to fit the new data, which can overwrite the representations of the old data.\n\n\n\nClass-Incremental Learning is one challenging scenario in CL which aims to update a model’s parameters and expand the classification layer to learn new categories while maintaining its accuracy on previously observed classes. Then during the test time, it assumes not to have access to task ids.\n\n\n\nThree major approaches have been explored to mitigate this issue:\n\nRegularization-based Methods: These techniques prevent abrupt shifts in the neural network weights by applying penalties that stabilize important parameters.\nReplay-based Methods: These involve storing a subset of training data and replaying it during the learning of new tasks to maintain previous knowledge.\nArchitecture-based Methods: These methods adapt the network structure, either by expanding it or isolating parts of it to retain past information.\n\n\n\n\nAll these CL methods bring additional hyperparameters to the learning process. For example: regularization strength, learning rate, memory size, etc. Current methods define these hyperparameters to a fixed value and assume that using the same hyperparameter setting will be sufficient for learning all different subsequent tasks. However, this approach does not reflect a realistic scenario. We can imagine 2 realistic scenarios:\n##High Plasticity- Low Stability: Let’s say you have learned large animal categories and now you will have to learn vehicle categories. In this case, you would go for mid-to low regularization strength to learn the new categories. In addition to that, you might want to store many exemplars from the large animal category in the memory buffer because you will probably forget that since the vehicle category will change the model’s parameters a lot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis time you have learned small vehicle categories and now you will have to learn large vehicle categories. In this case, you would think that these two subsequent tasks are intuitively similar so you don’t need to lower regularization strength because with high regularization, model weights will not change too much and current weights will probably be sufficient to learn the large vehicle category. Also, you might not want to store many exemplars from small vehicle categories because you did not change the model’s weights too much and you don’t want to use your budget unnecessarily.\n\n\n\nAdaCL (Adaptive Continual Learning) introduces a novel approach where learning rate, regularization, and memory size are treated as dynamic, tunable variables. Instead of being fixed, these parameters adapt according to the learner’s current condition and the complexity of the task.\nBut how to find optimum hyperparameter values?\nSearch Algorithm = Tree Parzen Estimators\nValidation set = some amount of data from the current task + some amount of data from previous tasks.\nTo achieve this, we use an AutoML tool which is Optuna and as a search algorithm, we apply Bayesian Optimization Tree Parzen Estimators. AdaCL searches and predicts the optimal values for these hyperparameters by evaluating the model’s performance on the validation set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur experiments utilized two well-known datasets: CIFAR100 and MiniImageNet. Each dataset contains images from 100 different categories, and we trained all models with 10 tasks, with each task containing 10 classes. Standard metrics for evaluation were used:\nAccuracy (ACC) measures the final accuracy averaged over all tasks.\nBackward Transfer (BWT) measures the average accuracy change of each task after learning new tasks.\nWe compared AdaCL with various baseline methods including EWC, LwF, iCaRL, and WA but the GOOD NEWS is: it is a plugged-in approach that means you can actually combine it with other methods that require better hyperparameter setting in CL.\n\n\n\nKey Findings:\n\nAdaCL boosts the performance of regularization-based methods.\nAdaCL yields better resource usage by leading to less memory size with the same performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdaCL treats crucial hyperparameters as adaptable, addressing the challenges of CIL more effectively than traditional fixed-parameter approaches.

We explore how Continual Learning can benefit from Dynamic Sparse Training, a process that closely mirrors the brain’s ability to constantly rewire and optimize its connections. Read on for a brief overview of our key findings 😊\n\nHey there!\nHave you ever wondered how our brains learn new skills without forgetting the old ones? Imagine learning a new language while still chatting away in your native tongue, or watching yourself grow from crawling to walking, running, and even biking—all while never losing that ability to crawl! It’s truly fascinating, and yet, teaching our deep learning models to do the same remains an exciting challenge.\n\n\nTraditional neural networks tend to overwrite older information when learning new tasks, which isn’t very brain-like at all. This major hurdle is called catastrophic forgetting. Imagine if every time you learned a new recipe, you suddenly couldn’t remember your grandma’s secret and delicious recipe anymore! That’s where continual learning (CL) steps in—allowing models to learn from a stream of data without letting past knowledge vanish into thin air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn neuroscience, it’s well known that our brain is always under a change and on the move! Our synaptic connections are constantly being reshaped or kept steady based on what we experience—a delightful dance of plasticity and stability that fuels our lifelong ability to learn and adapt. Picture your brain as a vibrant, ever-changing city where new pathways light up and old ones evolve based on your experiences.\n\n\n\nTo mimic this amazing ability, a technique called Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) offers an artificial version of the plasticity and the stability, ensuring that our neural networks remain both efficient and adaptable over time. Imagine starting with an overparameterized network, like a bustling metropolis with way more roads than you actually need. But instead of keeping all these roads open, DST acts as an ingenious city planner: it decides which roads to close down (prune) and which new ones to build (regrow) so that traffic flows optimally—all while staying within a fixed budget.\n\n\nWe kick things off by initializing our network using one of two methods: - Uniform Initialization: Every layer gets an equal share of connections, kind of like giving every neighborhood the same number of streets. - Erdős-Rényi Kernel (ERK) Initialization: Instead of treating all layers equally, ERK smartly allocates more connections to the “busy” areas (the layers with more parameters) and fewer to the “quiet” ones. This is a bit like investing more in the main highways that keep the city moving.\n\n\n\nAfter some initial training, the network doesn’t just sit idle but actively refines itself. Here’s how it works: - Pruning: Based on the magnitude of the weights, the network prunes away a fixed number (which can be scheduled) of the least important connections. Think of it as cutting off the rarely used, winding side streets to save resources. - Regrowth: To maintain the same overall sparsity level for each task, the network then regrows exactly same amount of connections. And guess what? There are three main approaches to choose which connections to regrow: - Random: Sometimes, a bit of randomness helps explore new possibilities, like testing out an unexpected shortcut. - Unfired: Alternatively, the model can explore the connections that is never tried or checked before. - Gradient-based: Finally, it can look at the gradient or momentum signals that indicate which potential connections could boost performance—and regrow those most promising ones.\n\n\n\nWhat’s truly fascinating in this approach is that, even though the network is carving out different “subnetworks” for each new task, it also allows for sharing connections between tasks. This means that if two tasks are similar, they can use the same neural “road,” which enhances knowledge sharing and makes learning even more efficient. It’s like having a communal library where everyone benefits from the same resources!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, combine DST with Continual Learning (CL)—a setup where a single network learns a series of tasks over time without forgetting earlier ones, just like how you can learn to cook a new recipes without forgetting grandma’s special.\nTraditionally, many systems tackle each new task with a separate network or by keeping extra data around. But here, DST is applied to one overparameterized network that evolves over time. As new tasks come along, the network dynamically adjusts itself by pruning away unused connections and regrowing new ones, while allowing to share common connections to build on past knowledge.\n\n\n\nFor those of you who love the technical nitty-gritty, here’s a quick summary of the key findings from our study: - Initialization Matters: At low to moderate sparsity levels (around 80–90%), the ERK initialization leverages the network’s capacity more efficiently by assigning fewer connections to narrow layers. This helps in learning incremental tasks effectively. At higher sparsities, ERK still doing its job when the right growth strategy is selected. - Growth Strategy Dynamics: The choice of growth strategy is closely tied to the initialization and the degree of sparsity. While gradient-based and momentum-based growth methods excel at high sparsity by carefully selecting promising connections, random growth performs competitively at lower sparsity levels where there’s less room for exploration. - Adaptive Approaches are Promising: There’s no one-size-fits-all DST setup. Even a simple adaptive strategy that switches between growth methods (like using random growth initially and shifting to gradient-based growth later) can boost performance compared to sticking with a fixed strategy. - Shared Connections Enhance Knowledge Transfer: Allowing the network to share connections between tasks not only saves resources but also boosts overall learning by transferring knowledge from previous tasks, much like how our brains reuse familiar circuits when learning something new.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy starting with a clever initialization, then iteratively pruning and regrowing a fixed number of connections based on weight magnitude and gradient signals, DST transforms a single, overparameterized network into a versatile, continually learning powerhouse. And the cherry on top? Allowing subnetworks to share connections across different tasks means that the network not only learns continuously but also builds upon past knowledge, much like our own brains do.\nIn this study, we dive deep into the various ways to run DST in a continual learning setup, offering both technical insights and inspiration for future research. We believe it is a beautiful blend of neuroscience and engineering—a step closer to creating AI that learns and adapts just like we do. Again, if you want to know more, you can check the paper 😊\nStay curious, keep exploring, and let’s continue pushing the boundaries of what intelligent systems can achieve! 🧠🚀\n\nThis post was written by Murat Onur Yildirim and need not reflect the view of co-authors."
