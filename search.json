    "text": "Mission\nOur mission is to scientifically understand and build AI systems with advanced capabilities, and make AI accessible to all to benefit all of humanity.\nWe invent new neural network architectures and train them in new ways to learn better and faster, study models systematically, and use our insights to automate this process so that AI systems can self-assemble and optimize themselves. Everything we create is open-source and crafted with user-friendliness in mind.\nIn this pursuit, we created OpenML, an global open platform with myriad curated datasets, AI models, and experiments, for streamlining machine learning research and making it accessible to all. We perform cutting-edge research on Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), Meta-Learning, Continual Learning, Foundation Models, Open-Endedness, and related fields, and validate our methods in projects that tackle sustainable development goals, including health care, food security, and climate change.\nYou can find our work in top AI conferences and journals, and we take pride in good engineering and open science to build AI models and systems that are widely used by people every day.\nWe are integrated in the Data and AI cluster, which does excellent research in all aspects of AI."
