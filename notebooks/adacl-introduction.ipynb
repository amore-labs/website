        "In the rapidly evolving field of machine learning, one challenge remains particularly persistent: the ability to continually learn new information without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. This forgetting problem is generally referred to in the field as “catastrophic forgetting”. Catastrophic forgetting occurs because, while models are learning new tasks, they lose the ability to recall information about previously learned tasks. This happens because the model's parameters are updated to fit the new data, which can overwrite the representations of the old data."

However, this approach does not reflect a realistic scenario. We can imagine 2 realistic scenarios:\n",

In addition to that, you might want to store many exemplars from the large animal category in the memory buffer because you will probably forget that since the vehicle category will change the model's parameters a lot."

Also, you might not want to store many exemplars from small vehicle categories because you did not change the model's weights too much and you don't want to use your budget unnecessarily."
