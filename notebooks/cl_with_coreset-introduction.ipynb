        "Continual Learning (CL) aims to enable models to learn sequentially from streaming data, retaining previously acquired knowledge while adapting to new tasks, a duality known as the **stability-plasticity** balance. This balance is critical for mimicking human-like learning, where accumulated knowledge is preserved (stability) yet flexibly updated with novel experiences (plasticity). There is big line of research that focus on achieving better stability-plasticity tradeoff by building and proposing new methods to literature."

      "source": [
        "## Motivation\n",
        "While these methods improve performance, they share a common assumption: all training samples are equally valuable and must be exhaustively utilized. By default, this standardized practice prioritizes plasticity (integrating new information) at the risk of destabilizing learned representations, as redundant or noisy samples may overwrite critical prior knowledge. This ‚Äùlearn-it-all‚Äù paradigm diverges from human learning efficiency since, as humans, we are initially exposed to vast amounts of information but intuitively filter and prioritize them, focusing on key experiences (e.g. clear and novel examples) that enrich our understanding while disregarding redundant details."
