aspects, including tabular and time series data, as well as efficient model finetuning. 
**[4 year position]** 

#### [PhD in Open-Source Large Language Models](https://www.tue.nl/en/working-at-tue/vacancy-overview/phd-on-open-source-large-language-models) (1 position)
Join a groundbreaking project to develop a next-generation, open-source family of foundation models. 
We are seeking a proficient and talented PhD student with a true passion for AI. 
You will play a pivotal role in a team exploring new large model architectures, novel efficient 
finetuning and adaptation techniques, refining data to enhance learning and generalizability, 
creating benchmarks, and ensuring AI safety.
**[4 year position]** 

#### [PhD on AI for Safety-Critical Multi-modal Learning](https://www.tue.nl/en/working-at-tue/vacancy-overview/phd-on-ai-for-safety-critical-multi-modal-learning) (1 position)
Are you eager to make a difference in the advancement of AI via reliable state-of-the-art deep learning models? 
We are seeking a proficient and talented PhD student to develop efficient, trustworthy AI models that have a robust 
understanding of their environment based on various data sources. For example, the model should be able to integrate camera, 
radar, and other sensor modalities. Particular attention will be paid to transformer- and post-transformer architectures, 
and how to adapt them to learn efficiently on resource-constrained hardware, for instance with transfer learning and quantization techniques.
**[4 year position]** 

#### [Postdoctoral Fellow in Open-Source Foundation Models](https://www.tue.nl/en/working-at-tue/vacancy-overview/postdoc-in-open-source-large-language-models) (2 positions)
Join a groundbreaking project to develop next-generation, open-source multi-modal foundation models. Collaborate with top research labs 
and experts and lead a new wave for research into transparent, efficient, high-performing models with novel capabilities that democratize access to AI.
We are seeking a proficient and talented postdoctoral fellow to develop advanced, multimodal, open source foundation models based on 
solid research on model architecture, data quality, scaling, generalizability, finetuning, and safety. The focus is on multimodality 
aspects, including tabular and time series data, as well as efficient model finetuning. You'll be part of a team with 2 PhD students and an research engineer.
There are two positions, one on large language models (3 years) and one of multimodal models (2 years).
**[2-3 year position]** 

#### [Research Engineer in Open-Source Foundation Models](https://www.tue.nl/en/working-at-tue/vacancy-overview/research-engineer-in-multi-modal-open-source-foundation-models) (2 positions)
