#### [Research Engineer for OpenML (2 years)]() (will open soon)
Would you like to work on open source software full-time and make machine learning more accessible and reproducible? 
Join us to build the next generation of OpenML, a popular open science platform for sharing interconnected AI artifacts (e.g. datasets, models, and benchmarks) using open standards and structured APIs. 
OpenML serves over 300,000 users, has supported over 1,600 scientific studies, and won the Dutch Data Prize.

For this position, you will help strengthen the impact and sustainability of OpenML, by:  

1. Modernizing Infrastructure to simplify deployment and streamline community contributions.
2. Improving Open Data, enriching OpenML metadata with FAIR-aligned elements (e.g. data cards and model cards), supporting diverse data types and modalities, and allowing integration with other open science infrastructures.
3. Enhancing User Experience through better interfaces and collaboration features.
4. Engaging the Scientific Community, ensuring that the platform meets the evolving needs of the open science community.

Specific key tasks include:  

- Update the technical infrastructure components of OpenML to more modern and contributor-friendly technologies.
- Enrich metadata by building on community standards such as Croissant, including quality metrics, DOI references, data provenance (e.g. data cards and model cards) and responsible AI metadata. 
- Extend support for more data modalities (e.g. imagery, time series, text, and multi-modal data), and domain-specific open data formats (e.g., genomic data).
- Streamline data loading into AI tools to facilitate AI experimentation in many scientific workflows.
- Update developer tools and documentation to speed up the onboarding of new community contributors and streamline maintenance.

We will provide you with an ideal environment for advanced AI research and collaboration. 
You will work directly with AMOR/e’s engineering team, including Pieter Gijsbers, Subhaditya Mukherjee, and Joaquin Vanschoren. 

You will also be supported by project partners in Leiden University, the SURF supercomputing center, and the Dutch e-Science Center. 
Beyond that, you work together with the wider OpenML community, especially the core contributors, as well as the Croissant community (led by Google and the Open Data Institute), and developers from other AI platforms such as Hugging Face.

#### [Research Engineer for OpenML (4 years)]() (will open soon)
Would you like to work on open source software full-time and make machine learning more accessible and reproducible? 
Join us to build a new international AI ecosystem around OpenML, a popular open science platform for sharing interconnected AI artifacts (e.g. datasets, models, and benchmarks) using open standards and structured APIs. 
OpenML serves over 300,000 users, has supported over 1,600 scientific studies, and won the Dutch Data Prize.

For this position, you will help seamlessly integrate OpenML with other Dutch and international infrastructures (e.g., SURF, NLeSC, Hugging Face) to transform it into a next-generation, unified platform for AI:

1. Allow people to access datasets and models uniformly from various hosting infrastructures.
2. Easily train and benchmark AI models transparently on scalable computational infrastructure.
3. Organize all data and results automatically for easier reuse and better reproducibility.

Specific key tasks include:  

- Redesign the OpenML platform architecture to streamline federation.
- Update the OpenML backend and APIs to implement integrations with other APIs (e.g. Hugging Face libraries, Harvard Dataverse) and compute infrastructure. 
- Improve experiment tracking from AI tools (e.g., PyTorch), using a tracking API or callbacks, with a focus on global community collaboration and better reproducibility.
- Accelerate AI-driven research: support team-based, real-time collaboration, share reproducible results via permalinks in papers, track impact metrics (e.g., dataset reuse), integrate with code repositories (e.g., GitHub) and publishing platforms (e.g,. ArXiv).
- Continuous infrastructure improvement, incorporating community feedback, improving scalability and simplifying maintenance.

We will provide you with an ideal environment for advanced AI research and collaboration. 
You will work directly with AMOR/e’s engineering team, including Pieter Gijsbers, Subhaditya Mukherjee, and Joaquin Vanschoren. 

You will also be supported by project partners in Leiden University, the SURF supercomputing center, and the Dutch e-Science Center.
