  description:
    Machine learning research should be easily accessible and reusable.
    `OpenML` is an open platform for sharing datasets, algorithms, and
    experiments - to learn how to learn better, together.

  description:
    The AutoML Benchmark (AMLB) is software that performs end-to-end
    evaluation of AutoML frameworks. It can be used to compare 
    current state-of-the-art and evaluate new methods with ablation
    studies. Over 10 AutoML frameworks can be evaluated out-of-the-box
    on over 100 datasets, and it's easy to bring your own data or
    AutoML framework.

  description:
    The General Automated Machine learning Assistant (GAMA) was developed
    to be able to easily experiment with new AutoML design through ablation
    studies by providing a modular AutoML framework.
  
    We have sunset the project, and decided to focus our efforts on OpenML and AMLB.
    If you are interested in a modern implementations driven by similar 
    philosophies, please have a look at the [AutoML Toolkit](https://github.com/automl/amltk).

  description:
    Self-Regulated Neurogenesis for Online Data-Incremental Learning (SERENA) is a neuro-inspired lightweight and 
    efficient method for Online Data-Incremental Learning, designed to continually adapt to streaming 
    data without forgetting the past knowledge.

  order: 4
  description:
    Continual Learning with Dynamic Sparse Training (CL-with-DST) investigates the evolution of sparse network topologies
    within the continual learning framework, where data arrives sequentially in a streaming fashion. This approach dynamically 
    adapts the sparse structure of the network over time, enabling efficient learning from non-stationary data while mitigating forgetting.
